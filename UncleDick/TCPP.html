            <h2>What it is about...</h2>
            <p>Corky has always seemed a bit strange to the rest of the Cottage Park community. But they've
                mostly been willing to overlook his eccentricities - a fact his family has been grateful for - 
                until one day when two teenagers are badly beaten and Corky is found standing over them, holding 
                a baseball bat.
            </p>
            <p>Now the people of Cottage Park aren't sure what to think.
            </p>
            <p>This poignant tale of one town's journey to forvigeness and love is sure to resonate with readers 
                of all ages. Transformative and full of heart, it's a story that will stick with you long after 
                you've finished the last page.
            </p>

            <h3>Reviews: 4.4/5</h3>
            <p>Forgiveness is at times difficult to come by. The facts of ten get in the way. I enjoyed the 
                story. It gives insights into Autism and how a family dealt with it. - 58 Brave
            </p>
            <p>The Cottage Park Puzzle makes you feel involved with the characters. I kept putting myself as the 
                mom of the different boys and think what I would do or react if that was my son. Who knows what we would 
                do or say. - Kindle Customer
