            <h2>What it is about...</h2>
            <p>
                Having retrieved the first talisman from the top of Mount Jinee, Tsalix and his friends are faced with another daunting
                task. They must cross Shayeksten, the Desert of Desolation to reach Mount Tsood and find the second talisman.
            </p>
            <p>
                Shayeksten is formidable, dry, hot, and covered with drifting sand. Compounding their promblem is their nemesis. Captain 
                Nash Doitosh and his band of soldiers, who are patrolling the desert and are determined to capture Tsalix and bring him to 
                Prince Abadon. If they are successful in crossing Shayeksten and reaching Mount Tsood they must find where the talisman is
                hidden and then return to Mount Deschee to deliver it to the king.

                "Love it. The story starts a little quickly but the writing helps you understand things and had a nice flow. Here we have the 
                journey of the protagonist and his friends who are looking for the second talisman. I enjoyed their journey in the first book. 
                And I enjoyed it in this book. You can see the development of the characters from the first book to this next one. I recommend 
                it if your into fantasy and historical reading." - Celeste C.

               "Tsalix Silverthorn and the Desert of Desolation is a great part of a planned trilogy. This is the second book in the series but 
               you can read it as a standalone as I haven't read the first one and still enjoyed this one. However, there are a few references etc 
               about the first book so it might be wise to read them in order.
            </p>

               This book is as much a look at friendship as it is about fantasy. It follows the remaining three of them through a perilous desert 
               on the quest to find the second talisman. I loved how they all supported and looked out for each other. How they survived that desert 
               - I did not think they would make it at points?! I really enjoyed the desert sections as they showed the true characters of all the 
               main players, especially Nash. It was great to learn his backstory.

               This was a descriptive book and managed to set the scene from the get go. Something which I think is hard for a fantasy writer as they 
               have a whole world to create not just a story! This was particularly the case when it came to the areas that the guys travelled to.

               I am looking forward to the next instalment!" - Lynsey

                "This is the second book in the Tsalix Silverthorn Series and is the Sequel to the Scepter of Destiny. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I am not usually a massive Fantasy Fan, but I really enjoyed this book (as much as the first).  I felt like this second one was 
                slightly better as you already know the Characters so more time could be spent on the story/ and the quest to find the second Talisman.
            </p>
                <p>     
                I really like Tsalix and the relationship he has with Asur and Kwercus, I think their friendship is a huge, and important part, of their 
                successful missions.  I expected more to happen with Tsalix and King Eloshas Daughter, but perhaps that Romance is still to blossom.
            </p> 
            <p>    
                The introduction of Dragons is very exciting and I am excited to find out what King Elosha has planned for them.
           </p>

                I am already looking forward to the Third Instalment The Maelstrom of Tears and the Adventures on Mount Litso." - Danielle Amor
