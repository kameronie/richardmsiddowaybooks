            <h2>What it is about...</h2>
            <p>
                The death of the King creates an even greater urgency to recover the Scepter of Destiny. The final battle between the twin princes to replace their father 
                as ruler over the Kingdom of Sodizen is imminent.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Abadon plans strategically to steal the talismans from Tsalix and his men, but freeing the scepter from its resting place in the mountain turns out to be 
                more difficult than imagined; and using it wisely proves to be fit only for the worthy.

            <h3>Reviews: 3.5/5 Stars</h3>
            <p>
                This is the 4th book in the series but does work as a standalone if needed without feeling you have missed anything. This is a brilliantly written fantasy book!
            </p>
            <p>
                Time to pack your bag and head on a quest! We go on a journey to get the Scepter of Destiny , the world the author has created is painted vividly in your mind as 
                you read it , you feel like you are part of the quest. The characters feature are great company on this quest , it is great getting to know them even more! The only 
                thing I would love is a bit on how to pronounce the names of the characters!
            </p>
            <p>
                This series is a must read for fantasy fans , you will be completely drawn into the book and find yourself lost in it!" - Sophie Narey

                "The fourth book in the Tsalix Silverthorn series, although I found it easy to read as a standalone.
            </p>
            <p>
                An easy reading fantasy adventure, that's exciting & compelling. With vividly descriptive scenes & well developed characters, whose names I found myself struggling 
                with throughout the book. I'm going to be checking out the first three books on KU very soon." - Staceywh_17

                "This is the final book in the Tsalix Silverthorn Series and I have enjoyed following the journey of Tsalix, Asur and Kwercus on their quest set by King Elosha.
            </p>
            <p>
                This book was such a good journey and reflected on parts from the previous books. It was quite fast paced as so much had to happen and it was sad to start with the passing of the King! 
            </p>
            <p>
                The ending tied everything up well, but I think it also left a great opportunity for a further book or two!" - Amor
