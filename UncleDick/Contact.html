                Richard Siddoway loves hearing from his readers! His books are written for the benefit of 
                others, whether that would bring autism awareness through his book, The Cottage Park Puzzle,
                or to bring remembrance of those he loves, Mom - and Other Great Women I've Known. By 
                hearing from his readers, it helps Richard Siddoway learn more about you and what you love to 
                read. He also loves hearing about how his books have changed the perspective of a situation for 
                you.

                him how it has affected you!
