            <h2>What it is about...</h2>
            <p>Will Martin has returned to his boyhood hometown to run the family real estate business. As they 
                approach their first wedding anniversary, he and Renee are deeply in love but their inability to 
                communicate threatens their happiness. Will would like to adopt Justin, Renee's seven-year-old son 
                from her first marriage, but he's not sure how Renee and Justin feel about that. He's frustrated 
                also becuse he can't locate Gary Carr, the boy's father, to get his permission. Added to the deepening
                mystery of Gary's whereabouts are mounting financial risks at work and the pressures of a burgeoning 
                political career. As Christmas approaches, Will wonders if he can keep all the balls in the air. 
                What he learns about honesty, integrity, friendship, and the power of love makes for a heartwarming 
                yuletide tale.

                "I love reading more about Will and Renee and their son Justin. A wonderful Christmas story. I had a hard time 
                putting it down waiting to see what would happen next. This was an excellent addition to the book The Christmas 
                Wish. I hope there will be another book to the series." - Gail
