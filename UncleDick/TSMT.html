            <h2>What it is about...</h2>
            <p>
                With two of the talismans recovered and returned to the King, Tsalix and his friends face a challenge 
                that will take them to the brink of death. Mount Litso is completely surrounded by the Sea of Tabass, 
                which has a whirlpool that travels across its surface. Not only is the water formidable, but the mountain 
                itself is guarded by giants who have pledged themselves to Abadon.
            </p>
            <p>
                The successful completion of this task will bring them closer to the completion of the mission they were 
                sent on by the King. They will have delivered to him the three talismans that lead the way to the Scepter 
                of Destiny.

            <h3>Reviews: 4/5 Stars</h3>
            <p>
              "This is the third book in the Tsalix Silverthorn Series and this series has really made me enjoy Fantasy Books. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I really like Tsalix and the relationship he has with Asur and Kwercus, I think their friendship is a huge, and 
                important part, of their successful missions.
            </p>  
            <p>
              Reading more about the Dragons was very exciting and also Giants and Mermen!
            </p>   
            <p>
              I was pleased to see the start of something between Tsalix and King Eloshas Daughter, but following the discovery 
              of his heritage I do not know whether that will continue!?
            </p>
              <p>  
              I am looking forward to the final instalment of this series “Tsalix Silverthorn and the Glittering Peak” to see 
              whether they are successful in getting to the Sceptor of Destiny!" - Danielle Amor
