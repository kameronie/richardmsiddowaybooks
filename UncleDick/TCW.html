            <h2>What it is about...</h2>
            <p>At the age of four, Will Martin lost his parents and went to live with his grandparents. The 
                warm memories of life in a small town and the old-fashioned Christmas holidays he and his
                grandparents shared sustain him still as a young man making his way in the world.
            </p>
            <p>Years later, Will takes a leave of absence from his job in New York City to return home after his 
                grandfather's death to help run the family real estate business. There he discovers something about his 
                grandfather's past that shatters him and the memories of the life he so loved. At dinner one evening, his 
                grandmother tells Will that she has been reading her husband's journals and learned that every Christmas 
                Eve, when she and Will were out doing their tranditional last-minute shopping, her husband was seeing a 
                woman named Lillian. This year, his grandmother's Christmas wish is for Will to find out who Lillian is 
                and why Will's grandfather, a seemingly devoted husband, saw Lillian every year for more than twenty-seven 
                years and never mentioned her name.
            </p>
            <p>As Will struggles to salvage the family business and learn the truth about Lillian, he approaches a revelation 
                that teaches his a lesson in the power of kindness, forgiveness, and live to uplift an entire community and 
                touch each life within it.
            </p>
            <p>With an inspiring message wrapped in an irresisble mystery, this heartwarming Christmas tale will be 
                cherished as a wonderful gift of the season by anyone who appreciates the magic of yuletide classics
                old and new.
            </p>
