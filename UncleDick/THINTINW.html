            <h2>What it is about...</h2>
            <p>From New York Times best-sellig author Richard M. Siddoway comes The Hut in the 
                Tree in the Woods, a hilarious tale of two young boys and their escapades in the 
                woods behind their house. Bill and Dick are cousins, and, according to Bill, partners 
                in crime. But mostly, Dick just goes along with whatever Bill says as the two of them and 
                their gang of friends -- all eight-ten-year-old-boys -- plan great adventures from their hut 
                in the woods.
            </p>
            <p>Delightfully told from a grown-up Dick's point of view, this short novel tells a clever tale 
                of the lessons learned from thsoe soemtimes ridiculous caper of youth
            </p>
            <p>From staging an Indian attack during a Pioneer Days parade through 1950s Salt Lake City
                to tunneling through mounds of snow on Roosevelt Avenue, the boys get into a load of trouble. 
                The also have a lot of fun. Many of their escapades will leave readers rolling with laughter 
                and recalling the days of their youth, days when the most fun was usually had with only a friend
                and a wild imgination in tow. The Hut in the Tree in the Woods will delight readers of all ages
                and will leave everyone rolling with laughter as they get to know Dick and his wild cousin Bill.

            <p>The adventures of mischievous boys in the 1940s in Utah. Autobiographical. The
