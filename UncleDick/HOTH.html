            <h2>What it is about...</h2>
            <p>
                Romance, friendship, brotherly love, love of country... Love in its many forms is portrayed in this 
                collection of timeless stories by Richard M. Siddoway, author of the bestselling book Twelve Tales of 
                Christmas.

                Travel to Miss Heacock's third-grade class and revisit the bittersweet longings of first love. Meet a 
                teenager who expresses his love for his younger brother - his rival on the basketball court - in an 
                unexpected way. Learn about unconditional love from "Brother Percy," a man who makes up for in spirit 
                what he lacks in size. And see how a little help from heaven can make a romance grow.

                In the gently nostalgic manner for which he is known, the author effotylessly recaptures
                the emotions of childhood, young adulthood, and beyond. The characters are vibrant and 
                real, from Clyde Hooper, whose frightening visage masks a deeply sensitive soul, to 
                Roland McArthur, the unlikely hero of a tragic love story, to young Jian Li, who 
                demonstrates true patriotism with one simple gesture. Their stories not only entertain 
                but enlighten in a subtle way, leaving the reader eriched and more appreciative of the 
                many expressions of love.
            </p>
            <p>
                By turns humorous and tender, this book reaffirms the importance of love and is sure to 
                warm the heart.
