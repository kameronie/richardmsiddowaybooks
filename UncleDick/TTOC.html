            <h2>What it is about...</h2>
            <p>Twelve Tales of Christmas is a collection of true stories that will delight 
                and entertain both children and adults as they  anticipate and celebrate the 
                Yultide season.
            </p>

            <p>Richard Siddoway, author of the nationally best-selling book The Christmas Wish, 
                warmly recalls Christmases past with a good mix of both humorous and poignant stories.
                As the author observes, "Earyly Christmas memories are dominated by Santa Claus and 
                gifts received. Later ones are dominated by Jesus Christ and gifts given." From the author's 
                advenures as a seven-year-old riding his new Flexile Flyer ("the Rolls Royce of sleds"), to 
                his experience with mean old Harold Peterson (who turns out to be more aptly described as "Herold Angel"),
                to his moving account of a seventeen-year-old girl, "misshapen of body if not of spirit" who finally gets a 
                chance to sing in the town Christmas pageant, the spirit of celebration and compassion 
                associated with Christmastime comes shining through. Not a single story disappoints.
            </p>

            <p>Perfect for family sharing, for an individual treat, or for a heartwarming gift for friends and loved ones, Twelve
                Tales of Christmas will continue to be a holiday favorite for years to come.
            </p>

            <p>This was a great book. Good stories that I had been looking

            <p>This is a fantastic collection of very well-written Christmas 
                stories. The stories make the holiday come alive as you read 
                them through different perspectives, from child to adult. It is 
                a family favorite and a book I treasure reading each year! - Natalie Griffiths.
