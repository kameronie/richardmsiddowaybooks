                "Such an adventurous tale. Very well written. Definitely for fans of Game of Thrones and LOTR. I must have the next installments so I can discover the powers the scepter will unleash and
                how Tsalix and his friends manage to collect the talismans through it all. Great book!" - AnAmazon Customer

                "This was a great reading. It takes places within a kingdom that is being battle by the sons of the king. It reminded me of the many films that have this importance about the king having 
                multiple male heirs. This one however relies on the destiny of three young men who have different occupation from one another. It was interesting to see why each one was needed for because 
                each had and learn different skills, they were able to make a great team. It was a slow beginning to set up the story but after that you will enjoy their journey. If you like stories such 
                as King Arthur or on a similar era this book is for you." - Celeste C.

                "I would like to thank the publisher and NetGalley for providing me the ARC of this amazing first book of the series. Review is based on my honest opinion after reading the book. The book is not 
                intimidating in terms of number of pages. It is easy to read and the storyline is very easy to follow whether it's the first person or third person doing the narrative. There are some areas of 
                concerns like lack of description as to how two characters known each other. Some other times a scene will be cut short and moves to another scene and it feels like it needs more narrative to 
                justify each characters journey. All in all, I really enjoyed the characters and how the role of each character rolled out throughout their journey. Magic system is not that bad. I hope that 
                on the next series, there will be more magic involve. World building is good, not too many places and landmarks that you need to write down to remember after you finish halfway of the book. The 
                approach to villain turned good guy is quicker in transition rather than most fantasy villain I've read that it's so hard for the villain to be good halfway through the story, or sometimes the 
                villain stays being a villain (SPOILER- I'm talking about the Lieutenant). Overall, this is an easy and very comforting read for me. I hope that you guys should pick this book and try because I 
                did enjoyed the adventures of the characters and I can't wait for the next books in the series." - Ian
