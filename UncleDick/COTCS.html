            <h2>What it is about...</h2>
            <p>When Robert's father suffers a near-fatal accident on Christmas Eve, the twelve-year-old boy 
                must not only take over the operation of the extensive family orchard but also wrestle to maintain 
                his courage in the face of mounting troubles. The Christmas tree with its colorful ornaments and gifts
                becomes a symbol of hope. But as weeks turn into months and winter turns into spring, the tree becomes 
                barely more than a stick, and the family struggles to keep their faith. Working to provide for his mother 
                and little sister, Robert also discovers that things are not always as they seem in the adult world.
            </p>
            <p>An inspiring adn heartwarming story about love and healing, keeping hope in the face of tragedy, 
                and a mother's determination never to give up, this book that will appeal to both young and mature 
                readers. Set in the 1950s, Christmas of te Cherry Snow takes a nostalgic look back at an innocent time, 
                when kids were free to be kids, when television was still a novelty, and when Christmas was filled with 
                magic.

            <h3>Reviews: 3.3/5</h3>
            <p>Great winter story, makes you count your blessings and remember what is important. - Kelly
            </p>
            <p>Easy read. It starts off as Christmas. It then takes you through spring. Sometimes the subject 
                is less than upbeat and you begin to wonder about the welfare of the characters. - Emma
            </p>
            <p>Great Christmas book! For everyone young and old and the whole family for that matter. - Audrey
