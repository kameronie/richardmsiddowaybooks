            <h3>Reviews: 3.4/5</h3>
            <p>I loved this book! It was well written and brought me to tears. There are people I know 
                who can relate to this story. Bittersweetness is a poison that can destroy. Forgiveness 
                and love are the antedote. - Gloria Salmon
            </p>
            <p>The Prodigal Father is a touching story that held my interest from the moment I picked it up 
                until I finished. - Craig Rees
            </p>
            <p>A great book that caused me to relfect on the damage of holding grudges. The story was entertaining while 
                being thought provoking. A great easy read. - Tia
